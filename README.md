# File-management-using-Python
This is a program I wrote using python designed to clear up my downloads folder, however it can also be edited to sort other folders. 
It takes files from the downloads folder and places them in their correct folder based of file type e.g ".pptx".
It also clears up duplicate files, by checking for the same SHA-1 hash.
I have this set to run every week using task scheduler.
